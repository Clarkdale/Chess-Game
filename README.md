# Chess-Game
Chess game developed using javafx for graphical interface. The initial board created with pieces
and background of beige and brown board squares, which can be seen in the issues section of this 
repository. Alongside that, there are also images of the game working, with pawns moved on the next
image, and example of restricted movement where a pawn was attempted to be moved to an invalid 
location three spaces in front of it. In this sort of circumstance, a message was sent to 
standard out stating, "Invalid Move." This game will also track which side's turn it is, as well
as allow the capability of castling. On top of this, moves are also highlighted on the board when a 
piece is selected, and turns do not end until the user selects a valid movement position on board
that is not the original location of the piece.
